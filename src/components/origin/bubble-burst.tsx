/**
 * Bubble Burst — a soap-film bubble that tears open where it is clicked. The
 * hole runs out from that point, its edge burning bright as the film retracts,
 * and the whole thing draws itself back together again.
 *
 * The burst is a **tear front**, not a fade. A hole opens at the struck point
 * and its boundary sweeps outward as an angular threshold, with the film simply
 * discarded behind it. Fading the shell out uniformly reads as the bubble
 * becoming a ghost, which is the one thing a bursting bubble never does: it
 * stays fully bright and stops existing, from one point outward.
 *
 * All the water the swallowed film used to hold is pulled into the retreating
 * edge, so that edge runs thick and bright — that lip is the entire visual
 * event of a burst. An earlier version also spawned hundreds of instanced
 * droplets riding the rim; at any size large enough to catch a highlight they
 * overlapped into a grey mass, and at any size small enough not to they were a
 * scatter of specks. The lip alone does the job the debris was there for.
 *
 * The film's colour is interference — thickness divided by how square-on the
 * surface is to the eye — so the bands crowd into the rim and crawl as it turns
 * rather than sitting on it like paint. Thickness is drained downward by
 * gravity, which is why the crown runs thin and nearly colourless, exactly as a
 * real bubble does in the moment before it goes.
